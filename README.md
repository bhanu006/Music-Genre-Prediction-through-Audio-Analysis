# Music-Genre-Prediction-through-Audio-Analysis
This repository contains our exploration into advanced audio analysis techniques, resulting in the development of a robust machine learning model for accurate music genre prediction.

Key Highlights:

Advanced Audio Analysis: Engineered with cutting-edge feature extraction methods, including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and spectral centroid, to distill essential information from audio data.

Comprehensive Model Evaluation: Employed industry-standard metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score—to comprehensively assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the developed model.

Exceptional Accuracy: Attained an outstanding overall accuracy rate of 93% for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, underscoring its proficiency in precise music genre predictions based on audio features.
